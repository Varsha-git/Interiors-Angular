## Interior

**ABOUT**
The project aimed at developing a webApplication for an interior designer named myself which displays their every detail of projects, that was divided into multiple segment
and shopping facility of their pre customized products for sale. I can say its an combination of featuring and sales platform together.
As sales platform 8 categories for sales which I have created Rest api to fetch data from database to showcase for user, shopping fetures like add to cart, remove from cart, 
check out and login was simply made using Google Authentication.
Most beautiful escape for this project was landing page it was really very awesome.  Even today I see it now it makes me feel proud about its all UI and UX desing and display
pattern and presenatation from landing page to Order Completion. As it was Interior designer website so it has tobe very unique and be very presentable and detailed.
It lead me to wining another award in Mega Pro show.
 

Here are few technologies which carved out my best possibilites in my projects.
HTML , CSS , JavaScript , JAVA , Oracle db , MySQL ,  Angular , Spring framework , REST Api , Git. Bootstrap
